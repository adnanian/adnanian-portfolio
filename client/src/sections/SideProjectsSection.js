                now, I will dedicate this entire section to Mada.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Mada is a Halal, math-based strategy card game for 2-8 players.
                The premise of the game is that each player has a personal
                number, called a position, which must stay within a universal
                range. You win by eliminating other players' positions from the
                range, until you're the last active player. If you would like to
                learn how to play, you can contact me using the form in the next
                section for an inquiry.
