## Overview

### What This Application Does

This is simply my personal website. I talk about my professional background and
showcase all my technical works and side projects.

### Why This Application Was Created

This website also serves as my portfolio. I showcase my works and link my other
social media, such as LinkedIn and YouTube. If somebody wants to get to know me
on a simple level, they can find this website here.

### Technologies

As of 1.1, Adnanian Order is a frontend web application. This website was built
using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with the React library. The application is
deployed using Netlify. You can find the live site here at 
[https://adnan-wazwaz.netlify.app/](https://adnan-wazwaz.netlify.app/). Netlify was used to allow form submissions
to send directly to my email address.

### Limitations

Because this is a frontend-only application, I had to hard code collections of
my techstack and projects. Another limitation is the difficulty of managing
appropriate styling for both desktop and mobile. As of 1.1, Adnanian Order is
successfully styled for desktop computers and mobile phones. However, there is
a lingering issue with tablets, mainly the technical projects slide show.

## Future Plans

I plan to improve the application by doing the following:

- Add a backend so that I can simplify the addition of new projects and skills,
without having to do so through code. This will be done with either Node.js or
a combination of Python, Flask, and SQL.

- Use a CSS framework like React Bootstrap to make styling easier, and compatible
for all platforms and screen sizes.

- Add animations for whenever I hover to or click on a component.

- Add more side projects and convert the slideshow into a slide of side projects
and not just for Mada.

- Add more technical projects.
